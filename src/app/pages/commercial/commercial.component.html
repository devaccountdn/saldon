            FINAL WALKTHROUGH
        </h2>
        <p>Prior to the closure of the project, our team will do a thorough walkthrough of the finished product,
            ensuring your full satisfaction. We also run you through all of the equipment, (how to change a furnace
            filter, where to shut off your hose bibs, etc.) to ensure you can comfortably enjoy your new space! We
            encourage our clients to keep in touch with our team even after we finish your renovation, so you will never
            be left in the dark!
