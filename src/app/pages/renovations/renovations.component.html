        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2em;color: #E8CB92;">INITIAL CONSULTATION:</h2>
        <p>
            To start off your renovation, we do an initial consultation so we can fully discuss your wants and needs for
            the
            project. Doing this ensures that our team understands your goals and desired look of the renovation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>This typically involves a phone conversation with a member of our team to discuss the main goals of your
            proposed
            alterations and schedule a site visit.

            VIEWING THE SPACE/SITE VISIT:</h2>
        <p>
            Physically seeing the space helps us visualize your concept, and allows us to have personal interaction,
            giving us a better sense of the project. During this step we plan our approach so that our team can provide
            you with the most accurate proposal. Here we discuss your plans for the project, if you have any drawings or
            if you prefer to have our team handle all your needs from design to completion.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>With our team’s years of building experience, we can provide you with an accurate and strategic proposal
            outlining all of the stages of construction with our detailed estimating methods ensuring you are not left
            in the dark or inundated with extras throughout the project. Once an agreement has been made and you decide
            to proceed with Gold Leaf as your build team, we will provide you with a detailed contract outlining everything
            from the scope of work, to warranty items, insurance items, cost structure, work, delivery schedule and
            total completion date.

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2em;color: #E8CB92;">DESIGN AND PERMIT PROCESS</h2>
        <p>
            We like to recommend a Design Build relationship, whereby our team would handle everything from the design
            (Architecture and Engineering) to the finished product. Having a builder/architect team gives you, as the
            client, the best chance at efficiently planning a project, as we have qualified staff to advise you on what
            design is more cost effective so that you can avoid the chance of designing something that is not within
            your budget. Our team works with some of the best Architects and Designers in the business and are ready to
            handle all your needs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>If you already have your design team in place, Gold Leaf is ready and willing to work with your team to ensure
            your project comes to a successful completion.

        <p> From foundations to finishes you will be provided with regular updates and you will have constant
            communication with our team who can answer any questions and address any concerns you may have throughout
            the project. Our team will help you through every phase of construction. We work with many vendors and
            subtrades who are the best in the industry and we will connect you with a consultant for every stage of
            construction who will assist you in procuring all that you need for your project, including floors,
            millwork, plumbing fixtures, lighting, furniture etc. Our team has spent many years building our
            relationships with vendors and subtrades, so our “team” helps your project run smoothly, efficiently and
            with a successful outcome.

            FINAL WALKTHROUGH
        </h2>
        <p>Prior to the closure of the project, our team will do a thorough walkthrough of the finished product,
            ensuring your full satisfaction. We also run you through all of the equipment, (how to change a furnace
            filter, where to shut off your hose bibs, etc.) to ensure you can comfortably enjoy your new space! We
            encourage our clients to keep in touch with our team even after we finish your renovation, so you will never
            be left in the dark!
