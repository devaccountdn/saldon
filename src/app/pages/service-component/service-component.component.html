        <span>When you come to meet our project team, you may already have the property on which you want to build or you may want to look at the beautiful communities we have available. Should it be on your own property, we will need the lot information to know what the building possibilities are. Once the property is determined, our qualified staff will work with you to create the concept/layout of your home. We encourage you to come in with your own ideas or inspiration pieces. If you are unsure, you can peruse through a SalDan book of plan concepts that you can either find what you want or get inspired from. If you’re looking to build in the GTA, Sault Ste Marie, or Sudbury, we work with an extensive list of Architects and Designers who can also assist in your search for the perfect home design. With this information we can create the plans for your home. We will also give you a customer information and selection schedule which will help you with your expected decisions and selection timelines.</span>

          With our team’s years of building experience, we can provide you with an accurate and strategic proposal outlining all of the stages of construction with our detailed estimating methods ensuring you are not left in the dark or inundated with extras throughout the project. Once an agreement has been made and you decide to proceed with SalDan as your build team, we will provide you with a detailed contract outlining everything from the scope of work, to warranty items, insurance items, cost structure, schedules and completion dates.

        <p style="font-family: 'Raleway';font-size: 1em;">
          We like to recommend a Design Build relationship, whereby our team would handle everything from the design (Architecture and Engineering) to the finished product. Having a builder/architect team gives you, as the client, the best chance at efficiently planning a project because it gives you design expertise as well as a builder’s advice on what design is more cost effective so that you can avoid the chance of designing something that is not within your budget. Our team works with some of the best Architects and Designers in the business and we are ready to handle all your needs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family: 'Raleway';font-size: 1em;">Should you already have your design team in place, SalDan is ready and willing to work with your team to ensure your project comes to a successful completion.

        <p> From foundations to finishes you will be provided with regular updates and you will have constant
            communication with our team who can answer any questions and address any concerns you may have throughout
            the project. Our team will help you through every phase of construction. We work with many vendors and
            subtrades who are the best in the industry and we will connect you with a consultant for every stage of
            construction who will assist you in procuring all that you need for your project, including floors,
            millwork, plumbing fixtures, lighting, furniture etc. Our team has spent many years building our
            relationships with vendors and subtrades, so our “team” helps your project run smoothly, efficiently and
            with a successful outcome.

        <p style="line-height: 1.4;">SalDan has been a Tarion Registered builder for 40 years, therefore, prior to the closure of the project, our team will do a thorough walkthrough of the project with you as per Tarion Pre Delivery Inspection Guidelines – ensuring your full satisfaction. We also run you through all of the equipment, (from how to change a furnace filter, to where to shut off your hose bibs, etc.) to ensure you can comfortably move in and enjoy your new home!.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4;">We encourage our clients to keep in touch with our team even after we have turned the home over to you. We will perform a 30-day review and a one-year review to correct expected minor glitches that come with new construction. </p>
